# One Carbon Technologies Website

## Stack
Static HTML/CSS/JS. No framework. Deployed via GitHub to github.com/izu0421/onecarbon.
Fonts: DM Sans Medium 500 (headings) + Outfit (body) via Google Fonts.
Videos: hosted on Cloudflare R2 — not in git (mp4s are in .gitignore).

## Colours
- --accent: #456BB7
- --accent-dark: #2f4f8f
- Original fonts (before DM Sans/Outfit): Fraunces / Figtree

## Pages
- index.html — landing page, hero video (ocean2.mp4 on R2), PROFILE sign-up form
- blog.html — blog index, 4-per-row card grid; individual posts are blog-*.html files
- our_story.html — company story + team grid (migrated from team.html)
- research.html — publications table with hover summaries, footnotes
- trials-v3.html — LIVE clinical trials page (full-header Three.js neuron animation); trials.html and trials-v2.html kept in folder but not linked
- team.html — legacy page, team content now lives in our_story.html
- purchase.html — £30 early-access kit sign-up (Stripe link pending)
- contact.html

## Page formatting defaults
- Content pages use `<header class="page-header">` for the top section — left-aligned, max-width 1200px, matches research.html and profile.html
- Do NOT use `contact-section` for new content pages (that class is centered, max-width 720px, and is only appropriate for forms/contact)
- Blog post pages use `<section class="blog-post-section">` (centered, max-width 720px, long-form reading width)

## Product / Stripe
- Single offer: **1C-01 Early Access Kit — £30** (60-day early-access programme), on purchase.html
- Stripe Payment Link still to be created; purchase.html CTA currently points to `#`

## Forms
- PROFILE sign-up form on index.html submits to yizhou@onecarbon.com via formsubmit.co
- Subject line: "FORM RESPONSE"
- Fields: Full Name, Email, Location, Age, Any questions?

## Conventions
- Use Edit tool for all file changes (no sed/bash edits)
- Push with: git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main && git push production main
- Two remotes: origin = github.com/izu0421/twocarbon (dev), production = github.com/izu0421/onecarbon (live site)
- Videos stay off git — they live on Cloudflare R2
- Jake's title: Co-Founder
- Product name: 1C-01 (not IC-001, not HSB001)
- Trial name: PROFILE, Phase I (not Phase II)
- Company name: OneCarbon (nav logo renders as `One<span>Carbon</span>`, plain text uses "OneCarbon")
